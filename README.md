This project is an attempt to provide insights into questions asked by the management team by
analysing the data provided by the product team of Instagram. To start with my analysis, I first
understood the different metrics provided. I understood marketing and investor metrics. Then, I
used the provided data for SQL analysis to find out the top-ranked oldest users, users who have
never posted a single photo on Instagram, the most common hashtag, the total number of users,
etc.
