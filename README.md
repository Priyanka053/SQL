I assisted in the attempt to generate business insights for the marketing, product, and
development teams in this project concerning Instagram user analysis by sending the data to
them using SQL (structured query language). During this process, I used various SQL queries
to collect the needed data. By using the data provided, I was able to determine the top-ranked
oldest user, whether the user had posted any pictures or not, the most popular hashtag, the total
number of users, and many other insights about Instagram.
